## Requirements
To follow this guide, you'll need some (obvious) requirements:
- GitHub repository with some Markdown files (the docs source)
- GitHub account with access to that repository

If you just want to try things out, you can [fork our example repository](https://github.com/unmarkdocs/landing-demo).


## Creating an UnMarkDocs account
If you haven't already, go ahead and [register](https://unmarkdocs.co/register). You'll also have to confirm your email to start creating projects.

## Creating a project from a GitHub repository
Once you're logged in into [your dashboard](https://unmarkdocs.co/dashboard), you'll have to click the `Create Project` button:

Finally, you'll have to select connected repositories. At this point you can connect one repository, multiple ones or all the repositories under that account/organization. Of course, you'll be able to remove/add repositories at any moment following the above flow again.
