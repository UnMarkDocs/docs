# Requirements
You'll need a project to follow this guide. This is such an obvious affirmation, it didn't deserve its own section.

## The Project Settings Page
All the Project settings are organized in a page in your dashboard. To access it, you just need to click the `Project Settings` button.

1) This section contains all the general settings.
    - 1.1) This setting allows you to customize the name shown on your dashboard and at the top of the sidebar in your project's page.
    - 1.2) This setting allows you to customize the URL that users will use to access your project's page (Unless you setup a [custom domain](custom-domains)).
    - 1.3) This setting allows you to specify the file that will be served when no page is specified. Think of it as an `index.html` file.
    - 1.4) This setting allows you to customize the branch where your documentation will be loaded from.
2) This section contains all personalization-related settings.
    - 2.1) This setting allows you to specify a URL to a custom CSS file that will be included on your project's page.
    - 2.2) This setting allows you to specify a URL to a logo that will be shown in your project's sidebar.
3) This section manages the autogenerated navigation.
    - 3.1) This setting allows you to enable/disable the auto-generated navigation.

There are also two other options in panels collapsed by default. You can show there options by clicking the `+` sign in the top right corner of the panel.

4) This section contains cache-related settings.
    - 4.1) This setting allows you to flush the cache of a specified page. Note we do this automatically so you don't need to do it every time you push.
5) This section contains dangerous settings
    - 5.1) This setting allows you to delete the project from UnMarkDocs. Note that using this option will not delete the repository from GitHub nor erase any content from it.

That's it! :sparkles:
